			<dt>Conflict choice:</dt>
			<dd>
				When a task has been edited in Toodledo and in TaskUnifier since the last time you synchronized TaskUnifier,
				TaskUnifier has to make a choice, keep the Toodledo version of the task, keep the TaskUnifier version of the task
				or keep the last updated one (recommended).
			</dd>
			<dt>Keep completed tasks for X days</dt>
			<dd>
				Only the tasks that are completed for less than X days will be kept in TaskUnifier.
				The other tasks will of course still be present on Toodledo's website.
