		<h1>What's new in 2.1.0</h1>
		
		<p>
		In this new release, two kinds of plugin can be installed :
		</p>
		
		<h3>1) Synchronization plugins</h3>
		<p>
		Via "Settings -> Synchronization", you can select a synchronization plugin which will allow you to synchronize
		your data with a third-party website or application like Toodledo.<br /><br />
		It is a two-way synchronization, which means your data will be the same in TaskUnifier or in the third-party website or application.
		<br /><br />
		Only one synchronization plugin can be enabled.

		<h3>2) Publication plugins</h3>
		<p>
		Via "Settings -> Publication", you can select a publication plugin which will allow you to publish
		your data to a third-party website or application like Google Calendar.<br /><br />
		It is a one-way publication, which means your data from TaskUnifier will be sent to the third-party website or application but
		if you change something in the third-party website or application, these changes won't be replicated in TaskUnifier.
		<br /><br />
		You can enable as many publication plugins you want.
